This repository is a Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site used as an educational "student" starter site (site root: `/_site` when built).

Quick context
- This repo builds with Jekyll and is deployed via GitHub Pages Actions. Key config: `_config.yml` (see `github_repo` and `baseurl`).
- Local development is driven by the `Makefile`. Typical workflow: run `make` (starts Jekyll serve), `make stop`, `make clean`, `make convert`.
- Notebooks in `_notebooks/` are converted to posts in `_posts/` using `scripts/convert_notebooks.py`. The Makefile triggers conversion on changes.

What to do first (fast path)
- To preview site: run `./scripts/venv.sh && source venv/bin/activate && bundle install` then `make`.
- If you only need to convert a single notebook: run `python3 -c 'from scripts.convert_notebooks import convert_single_notebook; convert_single_notebook("_notebooks/...ipynb")'` (the Makefile runs a similar command).

Architecture & important files
- Content: `_posts/` (markdown posts) and `_notebooks/` (Jupyter notebooks). Converted notebooks produce `*_IPYNB_2_.md` files in `_posts/`.
- Layouts & includes: `_layouts/` (page templates) and `_includes/` (partials like `custom-head.html`, `notebook_*_link.html`, `game.html`). When editing markup, change the layouts here.
- Scripts: `scripts/convert_notebooks.py`, `scripts/venv.sh`, `scripts/activate_*.sh` â€” these implement the local dev and conversion logic. Refer to them when automating conversions or CI steps.
- Build: `Gemfile` uses `github-pages` gem. `Makefile` wraps `bundle exec jekyll serve` and log parsing; use it instead of invoking Jekyll directly to preserve conversion hooks.

Project-specific conventions
- Notebook conversion naming: converted files include `_IPYNB_2_.md` suffix. Do not edit converted files directly; edit the source notebook in `_notebooks/` and re-run conversion.
- Front matter conventions: posts and notebooks expect YAML front matter (see examples in existing files). Dates must be zero-padded (YYYY-MM-DD). Use `search_exclude: true` in front matter to hide pages from search.
- Port and repo override: `Makefile` accepts `PORT` and `REPO_NAME` environment overrides. Example: `make PORT=4610 REPO_NAME=myrepo`.

CI / deployment notes
- Deployment is GitHub Pages via Actions (standard pages workflow). Avoid changing `_config.yml` keys used by CI: `github_repo` and `baseurl` unless you know deployment target.
- The repo expects `future: true` in `_config.yml` to show future-dated posts during local dev.

Patterns for code changes
- When adding UI components, prefer editing `_includes/` and `_layouts/` then wire them into pages via Liquid includes: e.g. `{%- include post_list.html -%}`.
- JavaScript games and samples live as standalone `.html` or under `assets/` and `_includes/game.html`. Keep interactive demos self-contained.

Examples to reference
- Convert all notebooks: `make convert` (uses `scripts/convert_notebooks.py`).
- Start dev server: `make` (backgrounds server and tails logs at `/tmp/jekyll$(PORT).log`).
- Clean site: `make clean` (removes `_site` and converted markdown).

When you are editing or creating content
- Edit source (`_notebooks/*.ipynb` or `_posts/*.md`). Do not hand-edit generated `_posts/*_IPYNB_2_.md` unless you intend to keep the generated form permanently.
- If a notebook does not convert correctly, inspect `LOG_FILE` (`/tmp/jekyll$(PORT).log`) and re-run `make convert`.

If you need more info
- Read `README.md` for full onboarding steps and `scripts/` for conversion/dev automation details.
- Ask for the preferred GitHub Actions workflow if you plan to modify CI or deployment.
