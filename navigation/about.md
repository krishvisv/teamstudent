### Culture, Family, and Fun

The mango is an important memento to me realizing i typed baseur1 and not baseurl and finally getting images to work..

- My friends and music are really important to me
- One of my favorite bands is a local band called Citrus Jr. I go to a lot of their concerts and I love local shows generally, as well as all music
- There are photos of my friends from across the states, a lot of whom are from the east coast. I met them at a summer program I did at Georgia Tech and I miss them every day
- Finding time for the people I love always makes me grateful for the life I live and the people I've met
