## Installation Hack

Welcome to your journey of setting up your Operating System and Tools! This setup process will guide you through working in a Linux terminal, managing folders, cloning a project, and adding packages.

## Version Control Commands

* **git clone**: Make a working copy of a git repository from the cloud to your local machine.
* **git pull**: Update your local copy of the repository with changes from the cloud repository.
* **git commit**: Save changes to files in your local repository.
* **git push**: Send updates from your local repository to the remote repository.

## Package Manager Commands â€“ Ubuntu (apt)

* **Update package list:** `sudo apt update`
* **Upgrade installed packages:** `sudo apt upgrade`
* **Install a package:** `sudo apt install <package_name>`
* **Remove a package:** `sudo apt remove <package_name>`
* **Search for a package:** `apt search <package_name>`
* **List installed packages:** `apt list --installed`

##  KASM Workspace Setup (Ubuntu Noble / Kali)

Thanks to improvements in the KASM image, getting started is fast and simple.

### First-time setup

```bash
mkdir opencs
cd opencs
git clone https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/student.git
cd student/
./scripts/venv.sh
code .
make
```

During the `./scripts/venv.sh` run, you will be prompted to enter your Git username and email to configure your Git commit identity. This only happens if Git is not already configured globally.

---

###  After restarting a session

Your data persists even after workspace restarts or destroys. Simply relaunch your environment and run:

```bash
cd opencs/student
source venv/bin/activate
code .
make
```
---

## Version Checks

```bash
ruby -v
bundle -v
python --version
jupyter --version
```

---

## What is `make`?

Think of `make` as a smart **task helper** for developers.

* It **automates commands** you would normally type one by one.
* It reads a special file called a **Makefile**, which lists tasks and how to run them.

### Example:

Instead of running:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
python3 my_script.py
```

Just run:

```bash
make
```

And it will do everything listed in the `Makefile`.
