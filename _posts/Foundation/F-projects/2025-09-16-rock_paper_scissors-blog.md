# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

**Link to the site:** https://krishvisv.github.io/teamstudent/rock-paper-scissor/

### What we changed and how

- Edited the YAML Front Matter block to change the layout from 'layout: opencs' to 'layout: base'
- Changed the rock, paper, and scissors assets by uploading the desired images into vscode under 'images/rps' and then replacing the old image locations in the code with the new ones (for example changing 'src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/rps/rock.jpg"' to 'src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/rps/rock-lobster.jpg"').
- For image context, they got changed to album covers that represent the asset. Rock became the album cover for Rock Lobster by the B-52's, Paper became the album cover for Paper Planes by M.I.A., and Scissors became the album cover for CUT by Panchiko.
- Through a similar process, we changed the background of the animated fight from the alien planet to a sparkly red and black checkerboard
- Saved, staged changes, committed and pushed changes to the repo so that changes show up on the GitHub page linked above.
