## How We‚Äôve Become Learning Experience Designers  

As a team, we recently stepped into the role of **Learning Experience Designers**: people who create engaging ways for others to learn as a collaborative group. One of our favorite projects was building a game to help beginners **identify different coding languages**: **HTML, CSS, Markdown, JavaScript, and Python**.  

At first, this might sound like a small detail, but knowing how to tell these languages apart is one of the most valuable early steps in programming. It‚Äôs like learning to recognize different alphabets before you start reading fluently. Each language has its own structure, purpose, and ‚Äúlook,‚Äù and being able to distinguish them helps beginners build confidence and avoid confusion when starting to code.

### How we used LxD in our Game
One of the most rewarding parts of this project was seeing how our **Learning Experience Design (LxD)** skills worked hand-in-hand with our **coding and game-building (Hacks)** skills.  

From the LxD perspective, we focused on:  
- Making the game **beginner-friendly** with clear instructions and progressive difficulty.  
- Adding features like a **progress bar** and **menus** to guide learners step by step.  
- Designing challenges that help learners **recognize coding languages** without overwhelming them.  

From the coding side, we:  
- Built multiple **difficulty levels** that change the way answer choices appear.  
- Implemented a **progress bar** that tracks advancement every 15 correct answers.  
- Created a **scoreboard** system to keep players motivated.  
- Developed **menus** to structure the start and end of gameplay smoothly.  

By blending design and technical skills, our team turned a simple coding quiz into a **thoughtful learning experience**. The design choices kept learners engaged, while the technical coding brought those ideas to life. This balance is what made the project both effective and fun.

## Peer Review Feedback: 9/18/25

During our peer review, the group suggested that we:  
- Add levels where the answer choices grow less obvious to challenge the beginner.  
- Include a leaderboard 
- Include a progress bar so there's more objective then just doing question after question 
- Create a start menu before playing the game so it feels more like a game

Based on this feedback, we made the following changes:  
- Added **2 more difficulty levels** where choices become harder to distinguish.  
- Built a **progress bar** that moves players up a level after every 15 correct questions.  
- Created a **scoreboard** (instead of a leaderboard) to track performance.  
- Added both a **start menu** and an **end-of-level menu** for better game flow.  
- We went a step further and added explainations that detailed what specific elements help to identify the code and what they do.

## Why This Is Important for Beginners  

When you first start coding, all the symbols, brackets, and keywords can blur together. By practicing recognition, learners can:  

- **Build familiarity** with common syntax and patterns.  
- **Understand purpose**: why each language exists and what it‚Äôs best used for.  
- **Reduce overwhelm** by spotting visual cues instead of memorizing everything.  
- **Lay a foundation** for deeper problem-solving later.  

Our game was designed to take that intimidating jumble of code and turn it into a fun challenge. By quickly identifying ‚Äúwhat language is this?‚Äù learners begin to see order in what once looked like chaos.

## Key Features to Identify Each Coding Language  

Here‚Äôs a quick guide we used in the game to help players recognize different languages:  

### üü† HTML (HyperText Markup Language)  
- Uses **tags inside angle brackets**: `<p>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`  
- Structures **content** on web pages (headings, paragraphs, links, images).  
- Think of it as the *skeleton* of a webpage.  

### üü£ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)  
- Uses **selectors** (`h1`, `.class`, `#id`) with **curly braces** `{ }`.  
- Defines **style rules** like `color: blue;` or `font-size: 20px;`.  
- Think of it as the *design* :fonts, colors, layouts.  

### üîµ Markdown  
- Lightweight, text-focused, uses **symbols like #, *, and []()**.  
- Example: `# Heading`, `**bold text**`, `[link](url)`.  
- Often used in **readme files, notes, and blogs**.  
- Think of it as a *simple way to format text*.  

### üü¢ JavaScript  
- Uses **functions, variables, and lots of parentheses** `()`.  
- Adds **interactivity** to websites (buttons, animations, popups).  
- Example: `function greet() { alert("Hello!"); }`  
- Think of it as the *brain* of the webpage.  

### üü° Python  
- Uses **indentation** (spaces/tabs) instead of curly braces.  
- Very **readable syntax**: `print("Hello World")`.  
- Widely used for **data science, AI, web apps, and automation**.  
- Think of it as the *versatile problem-solver*.

## How to Write Comments in Each Language  

Another essential skill for beginners is learning how to write **comments**. Comments let you explain what your code does without affecting how the code runs. Here‚Äôs how it looks in each language:  

- **HTML:**  

  ```html
  <!-- This is a comment in HTML -->
  ```

- **CSS**
  ```diff
  /* This is a comment in CSS */
  ```

- **Markdown**
```diff
  [//]: # (This is a comment in Markdown)
  <!-- This also works as a comment in Markdown -->
```
- **JavaScript**
```diff 
  // This is a single-line comment in JavaScript
  /* This is a multi-line 
   comment in JavaScript */
```
- **Python**
```diff
# This is a comment in Python
```

## Gameify

This is our game to help Beginners discover how to identify coding languages that are new to them. By recognizin syntax and layout, try to get as many as you can right. When you answer correctly, an explaination prompt will help you understand the details of the answer choice. Have fun!

## Final Thoughts  

Designing this game as a team showed us how powerful **learning through play** can be. Beginners don‚Äôt just need facts, they need ways to connect the dots, recognize patterns, and build confidence step by step. By focusing on the fundamentals of identifying coding languages, we created a tool that makes the first steps in coding a little less overwhelming, and a lot more fun.  

For us, becoming Learning Experience Designers means working together to **turn confusion into clarity through creative learning experiences.**
