## How We‚Äôve Become Learning Experience Designers  

As a team, we recently stepped into the role of **Learning Experience Designers**: people who create engaging ways for others to learn as a collaborative group. One of our favorite projects was building a game to help beginners **identify different coding languages**: **HTML, CSS, Markdown, JavaScript, and Python**.  

At first, this might sound like a small detail, but knowing how to tell these languages apart is one of the most valuable early steps in programming. It‚Äôs like learning to recognize different alphabets before you start reading fluently. Each language has its own structure, purpose, and ‚Äúlook,‚Äù and being able to distinguish them helps beginners build confidence and avoid confusion when starting to code.

### How We Used LxD in Our Game
One of the most rewarding parts of this project was seeing how our **Learning Experience Design (LxD)** skills worked hand-in-hand with our **coding and game-building (Hacks)** skills.  

From the LxD perspective, we focused on:  
- Making the game **beginner-friendly** with clear instructions and progressive difficulty.  
- Adding features like a **progress bar** and **menus** to guide learners step by step.  
- Designing challenges that help learners **recognize coding languages** without overwhelming them.  

From the coding side, we:  
- Built multiple **difficulty levels** that change the way answer choices appear.  
- Implemented a **progress bar** that tracks advancement every 15 correct answers.  
- Created a **scoreboard** system to keep players motivated.  
- Developed **menus** to structure the start and end of gameplay smoothly.  

By blending design and technical skills, our team turned a simple coding quiz into a **thoughtful learning experience**. The design choices kept learners engaged, while the technical coding brought those ideas to life. This balance is what made the project both effective and fun.  

## Peer Review Feedback: 9/18/25

During our peer review, the group suggested that we:  
- Add levels where the answer choices grow less obvious to challenge the beginner.  
- Include a leaderboard 
- Include a progress bar so there's more objective then just doing question after question 
- Create a start menu before playing the game so it feels more like a game

Based on this feedback, we made the following changes:  
- Added **2 more difficulty levels** where choices become harder to distinguish.  
- Built a **progress bar** that moves players up a level after every 15 correct questions.  
- Created a **scoreboard** (instead of a leaderboard) to track performance.  
- Added both a **start menu** and an **end-of-level menu** for better game flow.  
- We went a step further and added explainations that detailed what specific elements help to identify the code and what they do.

## Why This Is Important for Beginners  

When you first start coding, all the symbols, brackets, and keywords can blur together. By practicing recognition, learners can:  

- **Build familiarity** with common syntax and patterns.  
- **Understand purpose**: why each language exists and what it‚Äôs best used for.  
- **Reduce overwhelm** by spotting visual cues instead of memorizing everything.  
- **Lay a foundation** for deeper problem-solving later.  

Our game was designed to take that intimidating jumble of code and turn it into a fun challenge. By quickly identifying ‚Äúwhat language is this?‚Äù learners begin to see order in what once looked like chaos.

# Lesson: Identifying Coding Languages Through Game-Based Learning  

## üéØ Learning Objectives  
By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:  
- Recognize the key features of **HTML, CSS, Markdown, JavaScript, and Python**.  
- Write a basic **comment** in each of these languages.  
- Understand how game design can make learning more engaging. 

### Gameify

This is our game to help Beginners discover how to identify coding languages that are new to them. By recognizin syntax and layout, try to get as many as you can right. When you answer correctly, an explaination prompt will help you understand the details of the answer choice. Have fun!

## üß† Why This Matters  
For beginners, coding can feel like a jumble of unfamiliar symbols. Learning to **recognize different programming languages** is a critical first step. Each language has its own structure, purpose, and ‚Äúlook.‚Äù Knowing how to distinguish them helps learners build confidence and reduces confusion as they move into actual coding projects.  

---

## üïπÔ∏è Activity: Language Identification Game  
Our team created a game to help beginners practice identifying coding languages.  

- The game presents snippets of code.  
- Learners choose which language they think it is.  
- The challenge increases with added **difficulty levels**.  
- A **progress bar** and **scoreboard** track learning.  
- Menus at the start and end of levels create a smooth flow.  

This structure reflects how **Learning Experience Design (LxD)** principles can combine with coding to make learning fun and effective.

## üîë Key Features of Each Language  

### HTML  
- Uses `<tags>` like `<p>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`  
- Builds the **structure** of a webpage.  

### CSS  
- Uses selectors and `{ }` with style rules.  
- Defines **design** (fonts, colors, layouts).  

### Markdown  
- Lightweight text formatting using `#`, `*`, `[ ]( )`.  
- Common for **notes, blogs, and documentation**.  

### JavaScript  
- Uses functions, variables, and `()`.  
- Adds **interactivity** (buttons, popups, animations).  

### Python  
- Uses **indentation** instead of `{ }`.  
- Very readable, used for **data, AI, web apps, automation**.

## üí¨ Comment Syntax Reference  

| Language   | Comment Syntax Example |
|------------|-------------------------|
| HTML       | `<!-- This is a comment -->` |
| CSS        | `/* This is a comment */` |
| Markdown   | `[//]: # (This is a comment)` |
| JavaScript | `// Single-line` <br> `/* Multi-line */` |
| Python     | `# This is a comment` |

Even the table above was made with Markdown:
```diff
| Language   | Comment Syntax Example |
|------------|-------------------------|
| HTML       | `<!-- This is a comment -->` |
| CSS        | `/* This is a comment */` |
| Markdown   | `[//]: # (This is a comment)` |
| JavaScript | `// Single-line` <br> `/* Multi-line */` |
| Python     | `# This is a comment` |
```

## ü§ù Peer Review  
Through peer review, we received feedback to:  
- Add **levels** with more challenging answer choices.  
- Include a **progress bar** and **leaderboard** in our game  
- Add a **start menu** page.

We revised our game by:  
- Creating **2 extra difficulty levels** (level 2 and level 3).
- Designing a **progress bar** that advances every time an answer is correct. 
- Using a **scoreboard** instead of a leaderboard.  
- Adding a **start menu** and **end-of-level menu**.  

This cycle of feedback and iteration reflects real-world learning design: create, test, refine.

## ‚ö° Reflection: Blending Design and Coding  
This project showed us how **LxD and technical coding** skills work together:  
- **LxD:** Focus on clarity, progression, and engagement.  
- **Coding:** Build the functionality (levels, progress bar, scoreboard).  

The result is not just a quiz‚Äîit‚Äôs a **learning experience** where design supports understanding and coding brings the design to life.

## ‚úÖ Lesson Wrap-Up  
- Identifying coding languages helps beginners avoid confusion.  
- Each language has distinct **visual and functional cues**.  
- Comments are an essential skill for documenting code.  
- Iterative design (peer feedback + revisions) makes learning tools more effective.  
- Combining **good design** with **solid coding** creates powerful learning experiences.  

## üìå Extension Activity  
Try creating your own mini ‚Äúguess the language‚Äù quiz with 5 snippets of code. Write the correct answer, distractor answers, and include a comment in each snippet to practice recognition.

## Final Thoughts  

Designing this game as a team showed us how powerful **learning through play** can be. Beginners don‚Äôt just need facts, they need ways to connect the dots, recognize patterns, and build confidence step by step. By focusing on the fundamentals of identifying coding languages, we created a tool that makes the first steps in coding a little less overwhelming, and a lot more fun.  

For us, becoming Learning Experience Designers means working together to **turn confusion into clarity through creative learning experiences.**
